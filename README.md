# hello-world
This is a first repository to store ideas of a beginner in statistical and programming languages. I'm Martin and - for the beginning - try to become better at Python and R (read: tuning the knowledge progress bar of 1% to something like 20%). 


Don't expect too much in the beginning ;) 
I'd like to learn from the community - so hope to hear from you!
